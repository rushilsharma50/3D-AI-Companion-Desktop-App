## üéØ About The Project

A recruiter will spend about 10-15 seconds here. Explain the **what** and the **why**. What problem does it solve? What was your motivation? This is your project's story.

* **Problem:** Standard AI assistants feel robotic and lack personality. They operate in a separate window, feeling disconnected from the user's workspace.
* **Solution:** This project creates a lightweight, non-intrusive 3D desktop overlay character that provides emotionally aware responses and useful information. It's designed to be a friend, not just a tool.
* **Key Learnings:** This was a great opportunity to learn about integrating a game engine (Unity) with a powerful backend (Flask/Python) and explore the challenges of real-time, low-latency AI interaction using local models.

## ‚ú® Key Features

Use this section to list the most impressive functionalities. Think in terms of results, not just code.

* **Real-time Voice Interaction:** Utilizes local Speech-to-Text (STT) and expressive Text-to-Speech (TTS) for offline, private conversations.
* **3D Animated Character:** A fully animated character that reacts based on the conversation's emotional tone.
* **Desktop Overlay:** Renders as a lightweight overlay on the desktop, accessible at all times without interrupting workflow.
* **Python/Flask Backend:** Handles all AI processing, ensuring the Unity frontend remains responsive and performant.
